# garminconnect-pull

A vibe-coding repo for trying to pull data from Garmin connect. Something's clearly incorrect so figured I'd put it here.

- This primarily leverages https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect?tab=readme-ov-file
- I used Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot (because I don't pay for any of them) to create python
- It's failing somewhere but after two hours of creating, playing, and debugging it, I couldn't figure it out
- This (https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB?tab=readme-ov-file) also seems interesting but I didn't need it
